# DFGR
Deep Feature Graph Representation for Predicting Knee Osteoarthritis

### Our model:
![image](pic/x.jpg)
# DataSet
Data used in this article were obtained from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, which is available for public access at http://www.oai.ucsf.edu/. datasets used are baseline knee images with 0.C.2 and 0.E.1.

### OAI was divided into:

|              |  KLO | KL1  | KL2  |  KL3 | KL4 | Total |
|:-------------|-----:|:----:|:-----|-----:|:---:|:-----:|
| Training set | 2759 | 1278 | 1900 |  992 | 236 | 7165  |
| test set     |  689 | 319  | 474  |  247 | 59  | 1788  |
| Total        | 3488 | 1597 | 2374 | 1239 | 295 | 8953  |

# Credibility
Main issue with artificial intelligence models is not only accuracy but also the credibility of their decisions.
